Feature: A.2.19.1100. Control Center: The system shall support enabling or disabling of allowing users to provide their 6-digit PIN only once per session.
    As a REDCap end user
        I want to verify allowing users to provide their 6-digit PIN only once per session.

    #Scenario: A.2.19.1100.0100. Disable Security & Authentication Configuration "When e-signing, allow users to provide their 6-digit PIN..."      
    #Scenario: A.2.19.1100.0200. Enable Security & Authentication Configuration "When e-signing, allow users to provide their 6-digit PIN..."
#Redundant; verified in A.3.28.1200.
