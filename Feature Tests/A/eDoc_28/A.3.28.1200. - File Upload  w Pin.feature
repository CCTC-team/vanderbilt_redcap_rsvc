Feature: A.3.28.1200. Control Center: The system shall support Record-level Locking Enhancement with Password verification to external storage solutions (i.e., Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, and Microsoft Azure Blob Storage).
  As a REDCap administrator
  I want to verify Record-level Locking Enhancement with Password verification to external storage
#M This is being tested as a full part 11 test so that REDCap Admins learn how to use part 11 features
