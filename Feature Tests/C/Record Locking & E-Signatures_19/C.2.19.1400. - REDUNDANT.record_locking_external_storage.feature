Feature: C.2.19.1400. User Interface: The system shall provide a project-level option to enable the Record Locking PDF enhancement for external storage
    As a REDCap end user
        I want to verify project-level, and UI behavior for PDF enhancement for external storage
        So that REDCap correctly supports Part 11 compliance across sessions and file destinations

    Scenario: C.2.19.1400. User Interface: The system shall provide a project-level option to enable the Record Locking PDF enhancement for external storage
        #REDUNDANT - This test is redundant because Scenario: A.2.19.1000.0100. Disable Security & Authentication Configuration – Password only requires this project level option to be turned on.
