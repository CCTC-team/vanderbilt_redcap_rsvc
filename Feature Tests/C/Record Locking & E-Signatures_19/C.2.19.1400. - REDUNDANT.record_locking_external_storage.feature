Feature: C.2.19.1400. User Interface: The system shall provide a project-level additional customization option to enable the Record Locking PDF confirmation & automatic external file storage
    As a REDCap end user
        I want to verify project-level, and UI behavior for PDF enhancement for external storage
        So that REDCap correctly supports Part 11 compliance across sessions and file destinations

    Scenario: C.2.19.1400.0100. - Default state is OFF for new projects C.2.19.1400.0200. - Option is enabled and enhancement becomes available in the project
        #REDUNDANT - verified in A.3.28.1200.
