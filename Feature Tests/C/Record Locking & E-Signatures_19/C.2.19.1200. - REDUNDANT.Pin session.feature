Feature: C.2.19.1200. User Interface: The system shall allow a user to provide their 6-digit PIN once per session for File Upload field enhancement 
    As a REDCap end user
        I want to verify users are able to provide their 6-digit PIN once per session for File Upload field enhancement 

    Scenario: C.2.19.1200.0100.  One 6-digit per one session (trigger more than one 'File Upload' field enhancement to test)   
    Scenario: C.2.19.1200.0200. New session requires 6-digit again (log out between two new  'File Upload' field enhancement events - second event requires additional 6-digit pin) 
        #REDUNDANT - This test is redundant because Scenario: A.3.28.1100.
