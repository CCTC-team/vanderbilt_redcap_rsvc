Feature: C.2.19.1500. User Interface: The system shall provide a project-level additional customization option to enable the Record Locking PDF confirmation & automatic external file storage
    As a REDCap end user
        I want to verify the option to enable the Record Locking PDF confirmation & automatic external file storage is functioning as expected
   
    Scenario: C.3.28.1500.0100 - Default state is OFF for new projects  C.3.28.1500.0200 - Option is enabled and enhancement becomes available in the project
  #Redundant; verified in A.3.28.1200.
