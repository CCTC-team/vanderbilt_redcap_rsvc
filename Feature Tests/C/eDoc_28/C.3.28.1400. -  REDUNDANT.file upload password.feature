Feature: C.3.28.1400. User Interface: The system shall provide a project-level additional customization option to enable the File Upload field enhancement for password-verified uploads
    As a REDCap end user
        I want to verify option to enable the File Upload field enhancement for password-verified uploads is functioning as expected
      
    Scenario: C.3.28.1400.0100 - Default state is OFF for new projects C.3.28.1400.0200 - Option is enabled and enhancement becomes available in the project
#Redundant tested in  A.3.28.1100.
